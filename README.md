# Efficient and Secure Satellite-Ground Communication with AI-Powered Quantum Computing

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the source code, simulations, and results for my Final Year Project at Staffordshire University London.  
The research explores **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** using the **BB84 protocol**, with enhancements through **AI optimization** and **error correction (Shor’s code)**, focusing on secure satellite-to-ground communication.

## 🛠️ Features
- **BB84 QKD Protocol** implemented with IBM Qiskit.
- **Noise Models**: photon loss, bit-flip, and latency simulations.
- **Error Correction**: Shor’s code and ancilla qubits for error handling.
- **AI Optimization**: improves latency and key success rate.
- **Satellite Integration**: modeled with real-world satellite parameters (e.g., Micius).
